paragraph1_title: We define a new relationship to data
community_description: "Your Showcase is you and me: app users and people keen
  to understand privacy in relationships formed online. The collective is
  worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and exposed online. We
  aim to retake control of personal data on apps, understand the privacy
  problems they create, and work to improve data literacy."

mission_title: We work to understand what's being done
mission_description: >-
  We want to understand many privacy risks that we, as app users, are confronted
  with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads, discrimination resulting
  from data, incorrect profiling and predictions, and the possibility of
  phishing and identity theft by rogue users.


  Our ultimate goal is to bring together users and privacy enthusiasts to push for a paradigm shift.
partners_description: >-
  We are looking to collaborate with journalists, academics, researchers,
  activists and NGOs in data protection and other related themes.


  We push ideas for better user and company practices to control personal data and date safely online. We are particularly interested in raising awareness, as well as building methodological protocols and privacy tools for data protection and literacy.
